Circuit Craze is a game for learning about series and parallel circuits. It provides an interactive visual simulation to illustrate the concept of total resistance in an electrical circuit. Players can turn the bulb on or off by tapping the light switch, mimicking real-life actions. Additionally, players can select bulbs to achieve the desired total resistance. The learning experience is enriched with captivating storytelling centered on El, the main character, who encounters an unlucky situation involving an electrical short circuit. Players assume the role of helping El resolve the issue. In addition to storytelling, Circuit Craze utilizes several Apple technologies, including SwiftUI for interface design and AVFoundation for audio control, enhancing the overall immersion.
